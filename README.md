I'm going to analyze the 1st problem.

The object required:
- Map - 
  To generate map, and place the Thing into the map
  
- Driver - 
  Name and details

- User - 
  User that will order go-cli
  
- Coordinate - 
  Generate coordinate

- FileReader (contains format for args) - 
  To parse the file format on 1 args given to the Go-cli.rb
  
- Go-cli (as user interface) - 
  Go-cli could get 0, 1, or 3 arguments
  
- Thing - 
  Driver and User

*this is what I think at the moment, maybe it will change later*
